## This code has very different syntax to the old version of popini, keep that in mind when thinking about updating your library.
# popini
A C ini file parser and writer. Parses ini files into structures that hold individual values, like sections, keys, and comments.
## Keep note of this lighter and faster popini.
Other then the api being very very different, its also missing some features that the original popini contained. Think of this library being the [jsmn](https://github.com/zserge/jsmn) of .ini files. This means no searching for sections, and no writing back into a file with the strutures (in this case the tokens). This means all handling is done on your end, and no memory is used without your consent. Downside is the reason i made popini is kind of lost. The main reason i made popini was for the very feature of writing back into the file with the modified structures. While these changes may seem for the worse, keep in mind you gain in no compilation, and very light parser (which is actually more of a [lexical analtsis like system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis).)
